## My Personal Armory Projects


Hey, since I have no use of them anymore, here are a couple of things I made in Armory that my be useful for others. The code is CC-0, textures probably not lol.

 - foot
A browser-splitscreen-firstperson-football-local-multiplayer game. Seems like an Armory update switched rotations around because the second player looks 180Â° away from the ball instead of all the times directly at it.
- garv
Space Physics objects. Can't remember quite how I did it, but it still works in modern Armory.
- pump
One of the view games I actually finished. You protect baby-pumpkins crossing the road from a bad pumpkin at the top by flinging the player-pumpkin at it. You also need to block axes from hitting the babies by moving a log with A/D, and sometimes you need to click an a baby to make the not stop on the road.

The problem is that this game totally does not work in recent Armory versions anymore, first it uses multiple point light sources and then something else produces scary console messages, I guess related to normal mapped Materials but idk/idc.
-  FPS
A very fleshed out first-person controller made in logic nodes with a focus on smooth movement. The node setup is complicated, good luck if you want to modify it. I made some effort in trying to import .blends for levels at runtime for some kind of workshop-support, which is lifted straight from ArmorPaint. Also included is an Addon for Blender (gex) which can export a JSON for your .blend. It contains each objects name, and if it has any of the properties `jump , boost , gx , gy , gz` them and their respective values. This was also planned to be used to extend workshop functionality since I did not want any user to need to install all of Armory to make levels for this game.
There are probably still some remnant haxe files from when the game was multi-player, those are broken beyond repair though since I have lost the server logic.
